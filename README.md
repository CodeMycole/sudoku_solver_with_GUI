# sudoku_solver_with_GUI
A program that solves a sudoku table using backtracking with a GUI (in progress) all lines explained!

Currently the only functionality built into the program is taking an array and printing it to the terminal in a way that looks nice, and finding a spot on the board that needs to be solved. Next step will be to add a function that solves the squares and utlizes backtracking. After that the last step will be to make the GUI. The GUI is not necessary for the program as it will print the before and after to the Terminal, but my hopes is to make the GUI interactive with the player so they can play the game, and if stuck, hit a key to solve the puzzle.

# sudoku_solver
A program that solves a sudoku table using backtracking with a GUI (in progress) all lines explained!

Currently the code is fully functional. given a certain input in the array, the program will solve the puzzle, printing both the before and after to the terminal. I might do a GUI at a later time.
